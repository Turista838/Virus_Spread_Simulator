# Virus_Spread_Simulator

### Project developed for 'Programming', a first year subject @ISEC

#### Introduction:
...
The patients are initially distributed by the rooms randomly, but you can manually move patients between rooms.

#### Guide:

Once running, the program will ask you for the room list (binary file) and patients list (text file). Both files have to exist inside the project and must be inputed their name + extension (.bin || .txt).

After that you can:
1. Advance 1 iteration
2. Show statistics (Name, age, status...)
3. Add patient
4. Move patients
5. Redo X iterations (max 3 iterations)
6. Exit (a txt file with the current statistic will be created)
